# Encoder Decoder
This software is made for the purpose of Encoding/Decoding Messages and Statements. It allows you to keep history of the data you encode/decode. You can use multiple commands to manipulate everything.
# Commands
These are the current commands. You can use them inside both of the application. Please note that the logs are combined, while the history is seperated for both the encoder and the decoder. If you do not enter a command, or enter it correctly, it will simply be encoded/decoded.
1. 'exit' or 'close' to close the program
2. 'clear /history' or 'clear /h' to clear the history
3. 'clear/logs' or 'clear /l' to clear the logs
4. 'clear' or 'cls' to clear the on-screen text
5. 'clear /all' or 'clear /a' to clear everything that can be cleared
6. 'show /history' or 'show /h' for viewing the history
